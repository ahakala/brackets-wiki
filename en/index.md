## How do I win?
Try to pick as many winners as possible! Every round is worth more points for each winner. The person with the most points in the end is the winner. Here is how the scoring works:

Round | Points
--- | ---
1 | 2
2 | 4
3 | 8
4 | 16
5 | 32
6 |64

### What about these teams that have a play in game?
The NCAA has decided that the only way this could be more fun is to ADD MORE GAMES!!! These games show up in the first round looking like "North Dakota/South Dakota". If for some reason you choose one of these play in teams to go all the way please contact Andy with the name of what you think the winning team will be. Your bracket will have to be scored by hand but our experts will sort that out.

## What do I win?
The winner gets a Raspberry Pi starter kit! Yay!
